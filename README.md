# Analysis and Audit of Election Data Using Python

### This analysis was performed due to an audit request from the election commission. They are requesting further information on the breakdown of the votes cast within different counties in Colorado. Using Python, we can audit the full list of votes cast and their location, creating a chart to print all of the data to make it easier to view. 

## Election-Audit Results

- There were a total of 369,711 votes cast during this election.
